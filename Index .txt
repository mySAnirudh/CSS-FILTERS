    You can use CSS filters to add special effects to text, images and other aspects 
of a webpage without using images or other graphics. Filters only work on 
Internet Explorer 4.0. If you are developing your site for multiple browsers,
then it may not be a good idea to use CSS filters because there is a possibility 
that it would not give any advantage.
In this chapter, we will see the details of each CSS filter. These filters may not 
work in your browser.
